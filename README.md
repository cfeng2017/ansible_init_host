Ansible inital host
---

After install OS, We often tune the OS and inital some files, such as relove.conf, hosts and so on.

This script offers these modules:

- OS tune
- SSH key manage
- Redis tune
- memcached tune
- Hadoop/HBase settings

and I'll add Mysql initail files and other operations later.

**If your want to use the script, you should rename all files which name is `file_name.template` to `file_name` and modify them correctly.**
